user_description: Hello there. I'm Andrew, but you can call me Andrew. This is a blurb about me. It's not very long I'm afraid, only 350 characters or so. Alas, it would be longer than that, but I'm just not that interesting. At any rate, scroll down to find out more about me and the projects I work on. You can also visit my blog, where I write things sometimes.
